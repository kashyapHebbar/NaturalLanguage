# GoEmotions Text Classifier

This project is a multi-class text classifier built on the GoEmotions dataset. The dataset consists of 58k comments extracted from Reddit, human-annotated into 27 emotion categories or "neutral".

## Overview

The task involves building a classifier prototype capable of predicting emotion categories based on the text from the Reddit comments. The project takes an innovative approach by selecting only a subset of the labels for focused classification, while the remaining labels are merged into a new category.

## Data

The data used for this project is the GoEmotions dataset, comprising 58,000 carefully curated comments extracted from Reddit, labeled into 27 emotion categories and a "neutral" category.

## Dependencies

List the libraries and tools used in the project. For example:
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow/Keras
* NLTK
* etc.

## Installation & Usage

Instructions on how to install and run your code. For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goemotions-text-classifier.git
cd goemotions-text-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Methodology

A brief overview of your method. For example, if you used a specific machine learning model, preprocessing steps, feature extraction, etc. 

## Results

Summarize the results of your project. What kind of accuracy did you achieve? How well did your model perform? Add graphs or other visual aids if possible.

## Future Improvements

Outline any future improvements that could be made to this project, such as other models that could be tested or other data that could be used.

## Acknowledgements
