# CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a script for setting up a CI/CD pipeline.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need to give the `ci_cd_pipeline.sh` script execution permissions. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash

chmod +x ci_cd_pipeline.sh

```

After that, you can execute the script and start the docker-compose with the following command:

```bash

./ci_cd_pipeline.sh && docker-compose up

```
